#### Purpose of the Project
The pHTML-Multiverse-Construction-Kit is designed to provide a development environment that utilizes a custom HTML-like language (pHTML) for creating and managing multiverse structures. The project aims to facilitate visual and interactive learning experiences, particularly focused on astronomical concepts.

#### Type of Application
This application is a web-based development environment intended for educational purposes. It allows users to design and visualize multiverse structures, such as solar systems, through a graphical interface. The application emphasizes an interactive user experience, making it suitable for educational settings.

#### Target Users
The primary target audience includes:
- Students aged 11-14: The application is tailored for middle school students to enhance their understanding of astronomy, coding, and data structures.
- Educators: Teachers can use the tool as part of their curriculum to engage students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) subjects.
- Astronomy enthusiasts: Individuals interested in exploring and creating models of celestial systems can also benefit from this tool.

#### Main Features
1. Visual Editor: Users can create and modify multiverse structures visually without needing to write extensive code.
2. JSON and pHTML Support: The application allows users to import JSON data and create structures in pHTML format.
3. Interactive Canvas: Users can visualize their solar systems on a canvas, making learning more engaging.
4. Educational Analysis: The tool includes sections for didactic evaluation, highlighting its educational potential.
5. User Manual and Roadmap: Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide users through the features and functionalities of the application.

#### Technology Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The core technologies used to build the web application.
- Custom pHTML Language: A unique markup language developed specifically for this project, allowing users to create structured representations of multiverse elements.
- Canvas API: Utilized for rendering graphical representations of the multiverse structures.

#### Possible Use Cases
1. Educational Tool in Classrooms: Teachers can incorporate this tool into their science lessons to teach concepts related to astronomy and data structures.
2. Homework Assignments: Students can use the application to complete assignments that require them to create and analyze multiverse models.
3. Workshops and Extracurricular Activities: The application can be utilized in workshops focused on coding, data visualization, and astronomy.
4. Research Projects: It can serve as a platform for students to explore and present research on astronomical phenomena in a visually appealing format.
5. Personal Projects: Astronomy enthusiasts can use the tool to create their own solar systems and visualize them in an interactive manner.

# What is pHTML?
pHTML (Planet HTML) is a language for describing universes, solar systems, planets, stars, and other astronomical objects using an HTML‑like syntax.
Starting from pHTML 2.0, the language supports the concept of a multiverse, with the `<p‑multiverse>` tag serving as the main container for multiple universes.
If you know how to write HTML, you can already create entire universes!

✨ Simple and readable syntax
🪐 Specific tags for each type of celestial body
🎨 Automatic visual rendering
📊 Realistic physical attributes (mass, distance, composition)
